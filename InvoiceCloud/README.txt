This is the second task consists of creating a console application in VB .NET that reads attached file ICTest.txt, and 
outputs a file that follows the file layout from file ICTestOutputSpec.txt.

The output is not the same as the layout in ICTestOutputSpec.txt but I was able to read ICTest.txt, write to different
 file and edit a text file.
